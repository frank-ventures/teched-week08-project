This week we added Next.js to our quiver of arrows and were tasked with using the framework to build an interactive website where a user can make posts, others can comment on those individual posts, and also view/sort posts by categories.

In addition, we used Vercel for site and database hosting.

I kept track of my ideas, planning and progress here: [Planning](https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Thirty-Six-Project-Build-a-Blog-with-Comments-5b2c240021f44cffaf1d30ebbb256325?pvs=4)

### Requirements & Deliverables

- Created with Next.js.
- Design SQL schema.
- Create a 'new post' form.
- Create a 'new comment' form for each post.
- Refresh the `/posts` route and the `/posts:postID` route when making a new post/comment respectively.

**Stretch Goals**

- Posts can be sorted by category.
- Posts or comments can be edited.
- Allow users to 'like' a post.
- Allow users to 'delete' a post/comment.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to browse a list of posts, sortable by ascending or descending order.
- As a user, I want to see a list of categories, and click on a category to see a list of posts in that category.
- As a user, I want to be able to leave a comment sharing my thoughts on each post.
